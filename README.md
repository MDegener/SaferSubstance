# SaferSubstance

This is my final project for Harvard's [Introduction to Computer Science (CS50)](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science). The project was inspired by [reddit's](https://www.reddit.com/) ranking system.

SaferSubstance is a web page where users can share their own advice on safer recreational drug use to reduce harm associated with the consumption of legal or illegal substances.

### Features:

* **Search for substances:** Any vistor can search for legal or illegal substances to view the most upvoted advice on the respective substance

* **Sign-up/login:** Vistors can create a password-secured account to allow the user-login (passwords are hashed to ensure security)

* **Add advice:** Users can add advice on any substance that can be found via the "search" function (requires login)

* **Vote on existing advice:** Users can up- or downvote existing advice (requires login)

* **Suggest a new subtance:** Users can suggest new substances which should be added to the database (requires login)

* **Profile page:** The user profile lists all contributed advice and the associated up-/downvotes plus the total amount of karma (i.e. sum of all received votes)
